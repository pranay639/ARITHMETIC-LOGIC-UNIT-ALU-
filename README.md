Explanation:
ALU Module:

Inputs:
A and B are the 8-bit operands.
ALU_Control is a 3-bit control signal that determines which operation the ALU should perform (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOT).
Outputs:
ALU_Result is the result of the ALU operation.
Zero is a flag that indicates if the result is zero.
Operations:

The ALU supports five operations: ADD, SUB, AND, OR, and NOT. The operation is determined by the ALU_Control signal.
The ALU performs the operations using simple Verilog case constructs.
Testbench:

The testbench applies different inputs to the ALU and checks the result for each operation.
Each test case applies a value to A and B and sets ALU_Control to the corresponding operation code.
Simulation:

After running the simulation, the results of each operation are displayed along with the Zero flag to verify the correctness.
Simulation Report:
To generate a simulation report, you would:

Compile the Verilog code in a simulator (such as ModelSim, VCS, or Xilinx Vivado).
Run the simulation for a predefined time period and observe the waveform output.
Check the results in the simulation console (printed using $display in the testbench).
Verify that the output matches the expected results for each operation (Addition, Subtraction, AND, OR, NOT)
